# About

Find nearby restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries and other food and drink places. Locate them on a map, favorite them, see highlighted search area and get more details about each place.

### Project considerations

Mapbox is the first map I used, but later I switched to Google Maps as it has more options. Mapbox is still an option you can choose from, but it lacks functionalities like the restaurant page, so use Google maps for testing.

Also, I've built the favorites option for restaurants, instead of any place on the map, I only realized later it should have been for any place clicked. Still the commenting option works for any restaurant.

The restaurant locator works either by typing in the search bar or clicking on a map.

I didn't finish all the extras like filtering by rating, but I did add a table view, however I didn't have time to add pagination, I would probably finish it all in one more day.
